# OSV Vulnerability Remediation

This skill guides the automated remediation of security vulnerabilities reported by OSV Scanner in this repository.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Vulnerabilities
Read the OSV Scanner report at `build/osv-scanner/osv-scanner-scan.json` (or generate it by running `./gradlew osvInstall osvLockAndScan`).

For each vulnerability entry:
- Note the **Vulnerability ID** (e.g. `GHSA-xxx` or `CVE-xxx`).
- Note the **Package Name** and **Current Version** from `packages[].package`.
- Inspect `vulnerabilities[].affected[].ranges[].events` for the minimum `fixed` version that resolves the advisory.

### 2. Apply Remediation in `build.gradle`
Inspect `build.gradle`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Only edit `build.gradle`**. Do NOT edit `osv-scanner.toml` or any other configuration file.
> - **Direct vs Transitive**:
>   - **Direct Dependency**: If the vulnerable package is explicitly declared in `dependencies { ... }` or `buildscript { dependencies { ... } }`, update its version number directly in that declaration.
>   - **Transitive Dependency**: If the vulnerable package is NOT directly declared in `build.gradle` (it is brought in transitively by another dependency or plugin), enforce the fixed version inside the project-level `dependencies { constraints { ... } }` block at the bottom of `build.gradle`.
> - **Never touch `buildscript` for constraints**: The `buildscript { dependencies { ... } }` block at the top only accepts `classpath` entries. NEVER insert `implementation(...)` or `constraints { ... }` inside `buildscript`.

#### Transitive Dependency Constraint Format
Add the constraint to the existing `dependencies { constraints { ... } }` block at the bottom of `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ... direct dependencies ...

    constraints {
        // ... existing constraints ...

        implementation('<group>:<artifact>') {
            because '<reason / CVE / GHSA-id>'
            version {
                require '<fixed-version>'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Handle Breaking Changes
If bumping a dependency introduces compilation or API incompatibilities in the project, update the affected source or test files to restore compatibility while keeping the patched dependency version.

### 4. Verification & Formatting
Run the verification commands in sequence to ensure the fix is clean, properly formatted, and passes all tests:

```bash
# 1. Update OSV lockfile and verify no vulnerabilities remain
./gradlew osvInstall osvLockAndScan

# 2. Apply code style formatting
./gradlew spotlessApply

# 3. Execute test suite
./gradlew test
```

### 5. Execution Boundaries
- **CI Mode:** When invoked in CI, leave all modified files in the working directory. Do NOT execute `git commit`, `git checkout -b`, `git push`, or `gh pr create`; the CI runner handles commits, branches, and PR creation.
- **Local Developer Mode:** When invoked locally by a developer, summarize the changes and patched versions cleanly.
