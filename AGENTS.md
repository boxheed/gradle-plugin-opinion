# Instructions for AI Coding Agents (Jules)

Welcome to `gradle-plugin-opinion`. This document outlines the project conventions, branching strategy, and verification steps that all autonomous agents (such as Google Jules) must follow.

## 1. Branching Strategy & Target Branch

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **All Pull Requests MUST target the branch specified in the task / issue description (defaulting to `develop` if unspecified).**
> Never open Pull Requests against `master`.

- **Target / Base Branch:** Follow the branch specified in the issue/task (e.g. `- **Target Branch:** <branch>`). Defaults to `develop`.
- **Branch-Specific Remediations:** When remediating a vulnerability on a branch (such as a Dependabot PR branch `dependabot/...` or feature branch), checkout that branch, apply the fix, and submit the Pull Request targeting that specific branch.
- **Master Branch:** Reserved exclusively for releases and automated versioning. Never target `master`.

## 2. Dependency & Vulnerability Remediation

When remediating vulnerabilities detected by OSV Scanner or security issues, apply a two-tier strategy:

1. **Primary Strategy (Target: `build.gradle`):**
   - **Direct Dependencies:** If the affected package is directly declared in `dependencies { ... }` or `buildscript { dependencies { ... } }`, upgrade its version number in place.
   - **Transitive Dependencies:** Enforce fixed versions using Gradle dependency constraints within the project-level `dependencies { constraints { ... } }` block at the bottom of [`build.gradle`](file:///workspace/gradle-plugin-opinion/build.gradle):

     ```groovy
     dependencies {
         constraints {
             implementation('<group>:<artifact>') {
                 because '<reason / CVE / GHSA-id>'
                 version {
                     require '<fixed-version>'
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Never** add `implementation` or `constraints` inside `buildscript { ... }` (which only supports `classpath`).
2. **Fallback Strategy (Target: `osv-scanner.toml`):**
   - ONLY if no upstream fixed version exists in the advisory, or if bumping introduces breaking changes that cannot be resolved:
   - Add an entry to `osv-scanner.toml` under `[[IgnoredVulns]]` with `id`, `effectiveUntil` (YYYY-MM-DD), and `reason`.
3. **Commit Formatting:**
   - Follow Conventional Commits: `fix(deps): remediate <VULNERABILITY_ID>`

## 3. Verification & Build Commands

Before submitting a Pull Request, verify the changes locally:

```bash
# 1. Update/check OSV vulnerability lock and scanner
./gradlew osvInstall osvLockAndScan

# 2. Apply code style formatting
./gradlew spotlessApply

# 3. Run full build and verification tasks
./gradlew build
```

All verification commands require Java 17.
